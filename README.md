# Athletica
# Artusi Project (Python Edition)

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates the core functionality of the Codecademy **Artusi** project using Python. It demonstrates basic file system operations—such as creating directories, writing to files, reading from files, and listing directory contents—mimicking the behavior of command-line tools.

The goal is to provide a Python-based learning alternative to Bash scripting for users who want to build confidence in working with files and directories programmatically.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- File and directory manipulation using Python's `os` module
- Basic I/O operations (`open`, `read`, `write`, `append`)
- Console-based output simulating shell behavior
